# DoveConviene
This project is the proposal for the home page restyling of DoveConviene site.

This index is totally responsive, projected leading "mobile-first" method.
In fact, the base of the code is the html5MobileBoilerplate framework and it's compatible, as asked from the client, with IE7+ (and so jQuery 1.x and not jQuery 2.xx).
The css file is written by the rules of SMACSS method.
